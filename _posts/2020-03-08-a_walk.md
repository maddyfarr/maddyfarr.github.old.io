# The art of Taking a Walk 

**Hey friends!** Yesterday I went for a little walk about Kirchheim, the suburb I am living in. 

I took my headphones out, patted a big fat ginger cat, had a look at the church, and enjoyed the sun peaking through the clouds. 

It felt like spring was on its way, and daffodils were growing left right and centre. Now I know why they are my birth flower. yaya! 

It kind of made me think, "hmmm why don't I do this more often?" :O
