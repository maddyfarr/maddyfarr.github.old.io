# Mindfulness is underrated, even after all those colouring books!

**Hey friends!** So I have been reading this book. It's called "The Happiness Trap", and I just wanted to share it with you, because it has transformed my mental landscape over the last 2 months or so. 

For those of you who have never heard about this book, it is written by Russ Harris and based on a form of therapy known as "ACT" (Acceptance and Commitment Therapy), formed by Steven Hayes. 

ACT is a "mindfulness-based program for reducing stress, overcoming fear, and creating a rich and meaningful life." For those of you who have never heard about ACT, it is a modern form of therapy, similar to the more common "Cognitive Behavioural Therapy," except it is based on the idea that negative emotion and negative thoughts are okay and normal.

 It teaches you to take emotions less seriously, and waste less time fighting with them. Instead, this form of therapy encourages you to make room for these emotions, diffuse them (so you see them for what they are - just words), to be more present, and to focus on taking action that is meaningful. 

 Anyway, I may write a bit more about this, and even draw a few illustrations about the key messages, as this book really has helped me with many long term unhelpful thinking patterns. Let me know if this book has helped you too, or if you know anything about ACT. 

 I hope it becomes more popular in the future, as I think it could help a lot of people. 

 Anywho, that is my speil for now.
