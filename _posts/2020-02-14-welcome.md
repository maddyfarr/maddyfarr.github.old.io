# Willkommen im meinen Blog ~ Welcome to my blog

**Hello world**, this is my first blog post. I am a 21 year old Australian, living, studying and finally interning in Germany for a year. I have just completed an exchange program in Karlsruhe and I start an internship at SAP in Walldorf on Monday. 

I have started this blog to write a bit about my experience, include some of my drawings, develop my graphic illustration and web development skills, and write a bit about what I have learned along the way. It has been a steep learning curve for me in every way possible. 

I want to share some of the good times I have had, I also want to talk about the harder times and what they have taught me. I plan to write a bit about the places I have travelled to, (even before ending up in Germany) the history of these places, and a few thoughts about how we can all learn from eachother. I also want to include some reflections about self development, and a book I am reading called "The Happiness Trap", which has helped me immensely on my travels, and just in general. 

This has been an amazing opportunity thus far and has taught me so much. But like anything in life that brings growth and lasting happiness, it has had its harder times. 

So if you are interested, join me on my little adventure in the Northern hemisphere, and maybe I can make you feel better about some of the mistakes you have made recently, as I have had my fair share of boo boos. However, despite the odds to begin with, I seem to have risen from the ashes and managed to get a lot out of this experience - far more than I would have gotten from the English speaking friends, boozy nights, and wasted days that I had envisioned before getting on a plane to Germany.

I think that sometimes you do not know what is good for you, but the world has a way of showing you if you listen.
