# Willkommen im meinen Blog ~ Welcome to my blog

**Hello world**, this is my first blog post. I am a 21 year old Australian, living, studying and finally interning in Germany for a year. I have just completed an exchange program in Karlsruhe and I start an internship at SAP in Walldorf on Monday. 

I have started this blog to write a bit about my experience, include some of my drawings, develop my graphic illustration and web development skills, and write a bit about what I have learned along the way. It has been a steep learning curve for me in every way possible. 

I want to share some of the good times I have had as well as the harder times and what they have taught me. I plan to write a bit about the places I have travelled to, (even before ending up in Germany) the history of these places, and a few thoughts about how we can all learn from eachother. I also want to include some reflections about self development, and a book I am reading called "The Happiness Trap", which has helped me immensely on my travels, and just in general. 

So if you are interested, join me on my little adventure in the Northern hemisphere.
